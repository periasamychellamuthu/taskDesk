I had done this project during my internship in ZOHO. I have used mysql, java servlet and javascript in client side.Client server communication is based on ajax api call.


SYNOPSIS:
     Every organization consist of several teams, team workers, team leader(who manage workers and give task to all the workers) and administrator who is in the top position of the organization who controls all the members in the organization.Every team in the organization have their tasks that need to accomplish.It is very difficult for administrator or team leader who manages and tracks all the tasks that belong to their organization or team.This application helps administrator and team leaders to manage and track all the tasks that is provided to the team workers.This application also helpful for the teamworker, which gives information about all the tasks that the worker owned and help them to update the status of that task.
